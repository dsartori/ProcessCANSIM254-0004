1,"Numerous important footnotes exist for the correct interpretation of these data. Please contact the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics for the most current version of this information: 1-800-387-2231 or ccjsccsj@statcan.gc.ca."
2,"Represents actual police officer strength as of September 30 for 1986 to 1995; as of June 15 for 1996 to 2005; and as of May 15 since 2006."
3,"Represents actual civilian and other personnel as of September 30 for 1986 to 1995; as of June 15 for 1996 to 2005; and as of May 15 since 2006. This category includes all civilian personnel, special constables, recruits (cadets and trainees)."
4,"Rates are calculated per 100,000 population. Population estimates are provided by Statistics Canada, Demography Division and are adjusted to follow policing boundaries."
5,"Represents the number of fully-sworn police officer positions that the police department was allowed to fill during the calendar or fiscal year, whether or not that number of officers was hired."
6,"The Crime Severity Index (CSI) takes into account both the volume and the seriousness of crime. In the calculation of the CSI, each offence is assigned a weight, derived from average sentences handed down by criminal courts. The more serious the average sentence, the higher the weight for that offence. As a result, more serious offences have a greater impact on changes in the index. All Criminal Code offences, including traffic offences and other federal statute offences, are included in the CSI."
7,"Criminal incidents can either be cleared by charge or cleared otherwise (for example, through extrajudicial means in instances where a charge could otherwise be laid). The weighted clearance rate is based on the same principle used to create the police-reported Crime Severity Index, whereby more serious offences are assigned a higher weight than less serious offences. Applying this concept to clearance rates means that, for example, the clearance of a homicide, robbery or break and enter receives a higher weight than the clearance of less serious offences such as minor theft, mischief and disturbing the peace."
8,"Information on hirings and departures was not available for some police services. The net gain or loss represents hirings and departures during the previous calendar or fiscal year."
9,"The percent of officers eligible to retire is calculated using the number of officers for the year selected and the number of officers who were eligible to retire during the previous calendar or fiscal year."
10,"Based on the respondent populations for the previous year. Respondent populations for the current year are not yet available when Police Administration Survey data are released."
11,"Based on the number of police officers in the current year and respondent populations for the previous year. Respondent populations for the current year are not yet available when Police Administration Survey data are released."
12,"In 2015, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) implemented a new municipal billing model, which reflects the provincial integrated service delivery model that does not apportion the number of officers to a Municipal boundary or contract. As a result, the OPP Municipal Contracts do not have a fixed or static number of officers assigned at the police service level, as defined by the Police Administration Survey. Therefore, as of 2015, OPP resource data are available only at the provincial level."
13,"This table reflects the weighted clearance rates and crime severity index data available at the time of publishing. The weighted clearance rate and crime severity index (CSI) are updated every year in July with the release of data from the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey. For the most up to date weighted clearance rate and CSI please see CANSIM tables 252-0052 and 252-0083 to 252-0089."
14,"The data in this table represents Halifax Regional Police (HRP) only. It does not include data for Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Halifax rural which shares responsibility to police the same area. In 2019, when RCMP Halifax rural data is added to the calculation, the rate of police strength amounts to approximately 166 police officers per 100,000 population. The crime severity index and the weighted clearance rate are calculated using data from both HRP and RCMP Halifax Rural."
15,"The data for total number of civilian and other personnel in Halifax Regional Police are based on headcount rather than full-time equivalents (FTE's), which is the standard unit of collection for the Police Administration Survey going back to at least 2013."
16,"Starting in 2018, Langley Township, British Columbia includes both Langley Township and Langley British Columbia."
17,"Given that small counts of personnel employed by police service identified as “gender diverse”, the Police Administration Survey (PAS) data has been recoded to assign these counts to either “male” or “female” in order to ensure the protection of confidentiality and privacy."
